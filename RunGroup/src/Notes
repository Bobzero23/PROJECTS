RUNNING GROUP WEP APPLICATION USING SPRING MVC

SET UP
+ Create the project from spring intializr
+ Download the postgres for your operating system
    Note: while downloading after setting files and server there is a part
    you need to cancel on the way don't worry you will be fine.
+ Set up postgres in your ide(Intellij).
+ Create a model (entity class)
    Note: @Builder is used when you map the data you wanna fetch in the impl class
+ Create its repository (interface extends jpa) -> write your custom query inside of it ex. findById
+ Create the dto for better practice (expressing what to show to the user from database specifically)
    Note: you can just copy the exact field from the entity class but don't forget to delete the annotations
+ Create a service which is going to be an interface too, this actually won't do anything until we implement it
+ Create an impl where you implement the service and repository interfaces and the methods you want
    Note: do not use autowired just inject the repository class using constructor and then you will use it.
    Note: remember that you are doing the mapping from the entity class to its dto class so return the dtoObject
    Note: use the @service on the impl and not on the service interface
+ Create the controller and there you will tell the url paths and control the data
+ Add the view (html/css/js)
    Note: there is a dependency for letting thymeleaf adding the layouts
