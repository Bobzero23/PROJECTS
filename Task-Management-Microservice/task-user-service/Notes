ERROR
* Bean methods must not be final or private
* Even after implementing a customUserService you will get the default password if you do not annotate the interface with @Service.
* Couldn't find the proper jwt dependencies.
* I had to configure the lombok plugins cuz the id was new.
* While getting email from token use parseClaimsJws(jwt), instead of parseClaimsJwt(jwt).

NOTICE
* Spring Security will always give us the default username and password for login until we implement a custom userService.
