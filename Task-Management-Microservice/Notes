ERROR
* Bean methods must not be final or private
* Even after implementing a customUserService you will get the default password if you do not annotate the interface with @Service.
* Couldn't find the proper jwt dependencies.
* I had to configure the lombok plugins cuz the id was new.
* While getting email from token use parseClaimsJws(jwt), instead of parseClaimsJwt(jwt).

NOTICE
* Spring Security will always give us the default username and password for login until we implement a custom userService.

KNOWLEDGE
* Using OpenFeignClient we can communicate among the service (we can use a method that is being used in another service)

HOW TO USE OPEN FEIGN CLIENT
* Create a dto in the service you want to use OpenFeignClient
* Annotate the main class with @EnableOpenFeignClient
* Create the service interface and annotate it with @FeignClient(name="Name-Of-Service", url = "http://localhost:5001")
* Name-Of-Service must be the other service you want to communicate with
* Make sure to modify the 'url' property depends on the url your other service is running on.
* Then create the methods like you created in the other service CONTROLLER.
